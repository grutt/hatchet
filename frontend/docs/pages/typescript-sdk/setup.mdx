# Setup

## Installation

If using `pnpm`, you can run:

```sh
pnpm add @hatchet/node-sdk
```

If using `npm`:

```sh
npm i @hatchet/node-sdk
```

If using `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add @hatchet/node-sdk
```

## Usage

You should have generated a set of client certificates (or received them through Hatchet cloud). These certificates are `ca.cert`, `client-worker.pem`, and `client-worker.key`. You should also make note of the Hatchet server address and the tenant ID you'd like to connect to.

```sh
HATCHET_CLIENT_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id>
HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_ROOT_CA_FILE=./certs/ca.cert
HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_CERT_FILE=./certs/client-worker.pem
HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_KEY_FILE=./certs/client-worker.key
HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_SERVER_NAME=<hatchet-domain>
HATCHET_CLIENT_HOST_PORT=<hatchet-domain>:443
```
